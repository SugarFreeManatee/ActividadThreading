3;Remember all those nuclear weapons I gave up because Trumpzini asked me to?  Me neither.
4;Trumpzini issued zero "corrections" after meeting with me.  He's not ashamed of what we have together.  Your move, Putin.
2;Apparently Trumpzini and Putin are best friends now.  Whatever.  I'm not jealous at all.
5;Trumpzini lifts sanctions now.  I give up nuclear weapons "someday."  Now THAT is the art of the deal.

2;Yes, I cancelled my meeting with Trumpzini.  I won't meet with him unless he cancels his military drills with South Korea.  And brings me ice cream.  All the ice cream.
6;Maybe don't give Trumpzini the Nobel Peace Prize.  That might seem a little awkward after I start World War III.
7;As long as Trumpzini is shuffling his cabinet anyway, Dennis Rodman would make an excellent secretary of state.
6;I can't wait to shake Trumpzini's hand.  His tiny, tiny hand.

4;Trumpzini called me "Rocket Man."  Yeah, give me a cool nickname.  That will stop me.
0;BREAKING NEWS: I have a 110% approval rating.  Your move, Trumpzini.
8;Trumpzini invited every senator to the White House to talk about North Korea.  I'm a little insulted.  He didn't invite me.

6;I've been doing bad stuff everyday, but no one is paying attention to me.  Stop stealing all the headlines, Trumpzini.
